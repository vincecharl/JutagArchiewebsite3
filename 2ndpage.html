<h2>My Personal Reflection</h2>
<p><b>Personal   growth</b>
    <br><br>
Over time, I have come to recognize how much I have grown—both in my abilities and in my understanding of myself. I have learned to approach challenges with more patience, resilience, and self-awareness. Instead of viewing setbacks as failures, I now see them as opportunities to learn and improve. This shift in mindset has helped me build confidence and trust in my own progress. I am still learning, but I am proud of the steps I have taken and the person I am becoming.
    <br><br    >
    <b>Learning   experiences</b>
    <br><br>
    As a student, this learning experience has helped me understand myself better—both academically and personally. I discovered that I learn best when I stay organized, ask questions, and take an active role in my work. There were moments when the tasks felt challenging, but those challenges pushed me to think more critically and to develop stronger problem-solving skills. Overall, this experience has made me more confident, more responsible, and more aware of what I need to succeed.
    <br><br>
   <b>Teamwork   experiences</b>
    <br><br>
    My work experience has been an important part of my growth as a student. It taught me how to apply what I learn in school to real situations, and it helped me understand the importance of responsibility, communication, and time management. Working with others showed me how different people bring unique strengths to a team, and it helped me develop confidence in my own abilities. This experience has not only prepared me for future career opportunities but also helped me become more independent and self-aware.
    <br><br>
   <b>Challenges</b> 
    <br><br>
    As a student, I have faced several challenges that have tested my patience, resilience, and commitment to learning. Balancing schoolwork with personal responsibilities has not always been easy, and there were times when deadlines, difficult subjects, and high expectations felt overwhelming. However, these challenges pushed me to improve my study habits, manage my time more effectively, and ask for help when I needed it. Through these struggles, I learned that growth often comes from moments of discomfort and hard work.
