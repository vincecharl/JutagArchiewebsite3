    As a student today, I feel like I’m constantly surrounded by technology—my phone, my laptop, online classes, group chats, and all kinds of apps that make school easier. Sometimes it feels overwhelming, but it’s also amazing how much I can learn and do with just a few clicks. In the middle of all this, my faith has become something like a compass for me. It helps me decide how I want to use all these tools and who I’m becoming because of them.
    <br><br>
There are moments when technology makes life better. I can listen to worship music on my way to school, read a quick devotional during a break, or watch a sermon when I need encouragement. These things help keep me grounded and remind me that my faith isn’t separate from my daily life it’s part of it.
    <br><br>
But I’ll be honest: technology can also pull me away from what really matters. It’s easy to get stuck scrolling, to procrastinate, or to depend too much on AI or online answers instead of thinking for myself. My faith challenges me to stay responsible, honest, and mindful. It reminds me to slow down, take breaks, and stay connected to people—not just screens.
    <br><br>
For me, integrating faith and technology isn’t about choosing one over the other. It’s about finding balance. It’s about using technology in ways that help me grow, not distract me. And it’s about remembering that behind all the apps and devices, I still need moments of quiet, reflection, and connection with God.
     <br><br>
In the end, technology is part of my life as a student, but my faith guides how I use it. When I keep that in mind, I feel more grounded, more intentional, and more at peace—even in a world that never stops buzzing.

    Facing my fear of public speaking was one of the most uncomfortable experiences in my life, but also one of the most rewarding. During my first, presentation, my hands shook, and I spoke to quickly. Instead of giving up. I practiced regularly and asked friends to send feedback. By my final presentation, I  felt more confident and controlled my nerves. This experience taught me the courage does not mean the absence of fear-it means moving forward despite it. I learned that improvement is possible when I consistently push myself out my comfort zone.</p>
